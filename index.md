I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 7
This is my favorite lab because it was straightforward. It allowed us to talk to the terminal and give us information on where to park. It uses fun if statements to implement, and better helped me how to use terminal commands easily.

Lab 6, part 2
This is my second favorite because it was the most complicated one, therefore the most rewarding. It allowed us to calculate blackjack cards and add them according to the rules of the game.

Lab 4, part 2
I liked this one because I feel that it is the most useful in the real world. It does the math for you when converting numbers based on formulas.
